					The Spectrum token gives investors a cost-effective and secure way to
					settle payments with the benefits of a decentralized blockchain. We
					use a daily issuance adjustment mechanism to keep the aggregate price
					of all Spectrum tokens equal to the dollar value of gold in the vault
					(1 Spektrum â‰ˆ $1 USD). When the gold price rises, we issue additional
					tokens; when it falls, we burn some of the reserve tokens on the
					master wallet.
